Our framework is not perfect. In this file, we will collect everything that we will add in the future.
1. Fix the "browserWindowAfterClick" function from the dsl.ts file. The function should wait for the new page to load before returning the new page object. Implement a new approach that handle usage of already defined DSL functions inside a new browser page window.
2. Add a custom command in the domain-specific language to handle the alert pop-up window that appears after some time. We can use this from the documentation: https://playwright.dev/docs/dialogs
3. We need to find a way to verify broken images or links. We can use this from the official documentation because we should use vanilla JS for this : https://playwright.dev/docs/evaluating.
